Implementation of DSP on graphs approach

This project implements the Digital Signal Processing on graphs approach proposed in "Sandryhaila, A., & Moura, J. M. (2013). Discrete signal processing on graphs. Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions on, 61(7), 1644-1656." on a sample weather dataset of 18 cities of Southwest USA. The repository contains the presented posters and the implementation using MATLAB. This project was done as an application assignment in the EE338 - Digital Signal Processing course at IIT Bombay.
